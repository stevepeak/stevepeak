Hi, I'm the founder of [Story.ai](https://story.ai) and we turn ideas into magic. Technically speaking, it's a document infused with a conversational NLP program synthesizer. Our mission is to democratize software creation, utilization, and discovery as we believe everyone should have the power to create and contribute to the digital world.

1. Start with the word processor, the tool _every-single_ computer learns first and uses daily.
2. Infuse it with a conversational-based programming sythesizer that brings the document to life by painting it with colorful meaning.
3. Experience your story as real-world tools, apps, workflows, databases, and automations.
4. Take a deep breath and enjoy the present moment.
