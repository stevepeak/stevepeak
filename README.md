I'm the founder of [Story.ai](https://story.ai) where we turn ideas into magic. Technically speaking, it's a document infused with a conversational NLP program synthesizer. Our mission is to democratize software creation, utilization, and discovery.

1. Start with the word processor (the tool _every single_ computer user understands)
2. Infuse it with a conversational AI that brings the document to life by painting it with colorful understanding.
3. Publish the story resulting in real-world tools, apps, workflows, databases, and automations.
4. Take a deep breath and enjoy the present moment.
